/* foundations/typography

   Same shell as every other docs page: .demo-section with a real
   .demo-section__title, one left edge, and therefore an entry in the page
   map. It used to run its own 12-column band, LABEL (4) | CONTENT (8),
   which was the last survivor of a layout the rest of the docs dropped, and
   it cost the page its map entries and its alignment with its siblings.

   The one place two columns stay is the specimen list, and that is the
   point: a label rail on a fixed 11rem and the type beside it, so the eye
   reads one column of names and one column of type. Sizes here run from
   80px to 12px, and they only stop looking like a random staircase when
   every specimen starts at the same x.

   Chrome uses .typo-* classes; the one deliberate exception is the section
   lede, set in .demo-section__description so the page eats its own cooking.
   The ladder renders once: the surface, theme and viewport it resolves
   against are the header's segmented modes, not sections of this page. The
   raw ramps (text sizes, numeric weights, leading, tracking) are not
   documented here on purpose: the source is their truth. */
